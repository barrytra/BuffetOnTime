# BuffetOnTime

BuffetOnTime is a dapp which lets you pay for the time you eat. Money streaming is done from sender(customer) to receiver(Restaurant Owner) and the amount is automatically transferred per second

# The Problems BuffetOnTime solves
When going to a buffet in a restaurant, often times customers feel the amount they paid does not justify the quantity of the food they consumed, so they try to overeat to make their money worth it. Currently buffets have a fixed price, so the customer has to pay the price regardless of whether they feel the food quality was good or not.

Moreover, sometimes customers have certain dietary restrictions and they can only consume certain food items/dishes because of which they get over charged. BuffetOnTime helps users to automatically transfer money to the restaurant owner from user's metamask account per second for the time they are eating and they can still eat unlimited food. This helps users to get their money's worth as they can pay for exactly the amount of time they are eating. Users can also claim tokens for using our app which can be availed later to get discounts/benefits. It will also help the restaurant to not get overcrowded.

# Future Plans

* Implementing a system through which customers can trade tokens for discounts/benefits
* Integrating Push protocol to send notifications to inform the customer about the money transferred through the stream/money left.
* Fetch real time data of restuarants and adding more restaurants
* Improve UI and allow users to view reviews of restaurants

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

*Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!*

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
